My first Angularjs project.

This is my first Angularjs project.
This web app is a demo project ment to simulate a hair salon.

I am trying to build a single based web app with the following functionality:

1. User login - Using FB and email registration, users need to login and be kept in a database with personal info.
2. Contact me - form to be filled out with comments and questions about the website and the salon services.
3. Calendar - logged in users will be able to look at the hair dresser's calendar schedule and accordingly book appointments.
